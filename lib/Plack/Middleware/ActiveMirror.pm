=head1 DESCRIPTION

Hi, CPAN. My name is Shawn. I have a connectivity problem.

We have beautifully-designed Web Services (implemented by handsome
fellows!) for our C<$client> project, but we don't always have
connectivity to them. I like to hack from caf√©s with crappy internet,
which means lots of pain just to load a page, since each page has
to make multiple requests to our web services.

So I got to thinking, why not cache the responses from web services?
As long as the responses form a coherent, reasonably current snapshot,
it should work fine. Sure, I can't expect to do everything my app
supports just with these cached responses, but at least my JavaScript
loads, and that lets me limp along well enough to continue generating
billable hours. It's also fast as hell.

I tried using off-the-shelf tools first, like the wonderful Charles
Proxy (L<http://www.charlesproxy.com/>) and other Plack middleware,
but none of them quite met my needs. They can mirror sets of paths
just fine, but once you add query parameters into the mix, things
start to go south. I needed a bit more control in what was cached,
and how.

I also wanted to make sure that in the normal case of perfect
connectivity, my application would behave normally: every request
would proxy to my web services as usual. There would be an additional
side effect of putting every response into a cache, effectively
generating a partial, static mirror of my web services. Then,
when connectivity goes down the drain, I can flip a switch and now
ActiveMirror can serve responses out of cache on behalf of the
now-inaccessible web services.

=head1 THE CACHE

L<Plack::Middleware::ActiveMirror> relies on L<CHI> to manage its
cache. This gives you enormous flexibility in how your responses
are stored: in memory, on disk, in a database -- anything L<CHI>
supports.

=head1 OPTIONS

=head2 C<cache>

An initialized L<CHI> object that will hold your cached responses.
This parameter is required.

=head2 C<vary>

An array reference containing the methods to call on L<Web::Request>
to build a cache key. By default, we vary the cache key by C<path>,
C<method> (GET, POST, etc), and C<all_parameters>.

=head2 C<always_fetch>

If set to a true value, then ActiveMirror will not serve any requests
out of cache. The request will always be serviced by upstream. The
point of this option (instead of just removing ActiveMirror) is to
build up your cache for when you lose connectivity. So, by default,
set C<always_fetch>, but then when you go offline, turn off
C<always_fetch>.
